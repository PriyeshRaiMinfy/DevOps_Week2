# Assignment D1: Deploying NGINX Pod on Kubernetes – Summary

### Objective

Deploy a simple NGINX web server using a Kubernetes Pod definition file. This helped in understanding how individual containers run inside pods.

---

### I faced a few issues:

- Initially typed `nginix` instead of `nginx` when checking logs, which led to "pod not found" errors.
- Learned the importance of precise naming and spelling in `kubectl` commands.

---

## Steps Followed

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs nginx-pod-priyesh
kubectl describe pod nginx-pod-priyesh
```

### Output Samples

```
pod/nginx-pod-priyesh created

NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-pod-priyesh   1/1     Running   0          2m

# Assignment D2: NGINX Deployment on Kubernetes â€“ Summary

### Objective

Create a scalable Deployment for NGINX instead of a single Pod. This introduces ReplicaSets and ensures the application stays available.

---

### I faced a few issues:

- I had to ensure that the selector matched the pod template labels, otherwise, no pods would get created.

---

## Steps Followed

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get rs
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
```

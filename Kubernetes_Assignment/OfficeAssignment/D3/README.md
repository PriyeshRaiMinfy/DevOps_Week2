# Assignment D3: Exposing NGINX Deployment with Service â€“ Summary

### Objective

Expose the NGINX Deployment using a Kubernetes Service of type NodePort to allow access from outside the cluster.

---

### I faced a few issues:

- Initially tried to access the pod directly using its IP, which failed since it's only reachable inside the cluster.
- Learned the difference between ClusterIP, NodePort, and how `minikube service` simplifies testing.

---

## Steps Followed

```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
kubectl get svc
minikube service nginx-service
```
